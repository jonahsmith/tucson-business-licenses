# Tucson Business License Geocoding

This is an analysis I carried out on the database of Tucson business licenses
for the *The New York Times* Student Journalism Institute in 2015.

The original data sets are available on [the city's
webpage](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/finance/business-license-downloads). The
initial motivation for the analysis was to look at growth patterns in businesses
in proximity to the City's new street car line.

A story written by Polo Rocha on that topic will be available soon, as well as
a blog post with the methodology and process involved with the analysis.
