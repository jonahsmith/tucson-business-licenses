# Tucson Business License Geocoding

This is an analysis I carried out on the database of Tucson business licenses
for the *The New York Times* Student Journalism Institute in 2015.

The original data sets are available on [the city's
webpage](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/finance/business-license-downloads).

A story written by Polo Rocha will be available soon, as well as a blog post
with the methodology and process involved with the analysis.
